    <h4 class="ui header left">2. Code conventions</h4>

    Write down what is your understanding of the coding conventions. Why they are important to follow? What kind of conventions you are going to use. </p>
    <div class="ui inverted segment">
        <p> Code Convention (CC) is a combination of the regulations to bind the coding progress of a project. It is a set of guidelines for a specific programming language that recommend programming style, practices, and methods for each aspect of a program written in that language.</p>

        <p>CC is important to follow because it creates the consistency and readablity of the project/software, allowing the engineers to understand the new code more quickly and thoroughly. </p>

        <p> Kind of conventions I follow are: </p>

        <div class="ui bulleted list">
                <div class="item"> Character encoding [ HTML ]: Quickly and easily ensure proper rendering of your content by declaring an explicit character encoding. <br>
                            When doing so, you may avoid using character entities in your HTML, provided their encoding matches that of the document (generally UTF-8).             
                 </div>
                <img src="images/characterencoding.JPG">
                <div class="item"> Reducing markup [ HTML ]: Whenever possible, avoid superfluous parent elements when writing HTML. <br>
                Many times this requires iteration and refactoring, but produces less HTML. Take the following example:
                </div>
                <img src="images/reducingmarkup.JPG">
                <div class="item"> Don't use @import, instead of that using &lt;link&gt; elements. </div>

        <strong><p> 1. RWD </p></strong>
        Responsive web design (RWD) is one of the trendiest technology buzz words in web development. The tearms was originally introduced <br>
        in Ethen Marcotte's A list Apart article: <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design"> http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design </a><br>
          a. Read the article carefully <br>
          b. Review also all the examples in the article. Review the code and see how the responsiveness develops between different versions. <br>

          Answer to following <strong>questions</strong>: 
          <ul class="ui list">
              <li> What is the purpose of the RWD? Why it is used? How things are done before RWD? What is the difference? </li>
              <li> How css media queries can help you building responsive web sites ? </li>
              <li> Why to use em (font) based sizing for example margins? </li>
          </ul>
<div class="ui inverted segment">
        <ul class="ui list>">
            <li> Purpose of RWD is to make our design not only flexible in desktop-centric context but also optimized well in other platform (Tablet, Phone, etc...) and in any resolution. As mentioned in the article: "When viewed at viewport smaller than 800x600, the illustration behind the logo quickly becomes cropped, navigation text can wrap in an unseemly manner, and the images along the bottom, become too compact to appear legible." Responsive websites are built on a fluid grid and use media queries to control the design and its content as it scales down or up with the browser or device. </li>
            <li> A media query allows us to target not only certain device classes, but to actually inspect the physical characteristics of the device rendering our work. For example, following the recent rise of mobile WebKit, media queries became a popular client-side technique for delivering a tailored style sheet to the iPhone, Android phones, and their ilk. The query contains two components: a media type (screen), and the actual query enclosed within parentheses, containing a particular media feature (max-device-width) to inspect, followed by the target value. </li>
            <li> Because you're going to need to change font sizes for different screen sizes. Since a pixel has nothing to do with a real pixel on your screen.
          </ul>
  </div>
        <strong> <p> 2. RWD Examples </p> </strong>
        <p> See few RWD examples. Test how different sizes works in desktop browser. Test also sites on mobiles </p>

        <p> Take screenshots of the sites on different devices and screen sizes </p>

<div class="ui inverted segment">
        <img class="ui centered massive image" src="images/steelseries.jpg"> <br>
        <img class="ui centered massive image" src="images/gsmarena.jpg"> <br>
        <img class="ui centered massive image" src="images/theverge.jpg">

  </div>

    <strong><p> 3. RWD in practice </p> </strong>
    <p> Create a simple responsive web page where nothing is defined as pixels. Use CSS-reset, and remember to follow coding conventions. Styles must be stored in separate .css files. </p>
    <div class="ui inverted segment">
        Click <a href="responsiveweb.html">here</a> to go the website which is for exercise 3 / Lab2.
      </div>
          <strong><p> 5. Adding Stuff </p> </strong>
          <p> a. Create a copy of previous task. </p>
          <p> b. Add a menu to it. Menu should be on the left side of the screen on wide screen, but on the top on mobile portrait screen. </p>
          <p> c. HTML 5 specification introduces new semantic elements. One of them is a &lt;figure&gt; element. Can you say why you should use it in addition to standard &lt;img&gt; elements ? </p>
          <p> d. Add new figure elements to previous assignment. Images should scale keeping their aspect ratio based on the width of the document. </p>
        <div class="ui inverted segment">
          <p> a. b. d. Click <a href="lab2ex5.html"/> here </a> to go to the Lab2/Exercise 5.</p>
          <p> c. Image needs a caption and &lt;figure&gt; is born to make the caption for the picture, which makes the article more clearly. </p>
        </div>

  <strong> <p>1. Web Sockets: </p></strong>
  <p> Read this article: <a href="http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/">http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/websockets/basics/"</a> . What kind of
problems web sockets solve? In what kind of situations you should use them? </p>
  <p> I have created a simple chat server which can be used with web sockets. Create a web
chat client which can be used to chat with the server. Chat server can use unencrypted or
encrypted sockets. Protocol is very simple. Just print everything you get from the socket
and any data you send will be considered as message. You can find it from:
<a href="ws://obscure-waters-98157.herokuapp.com">ws://obscure-waters-98157.herokuapp.com</a> or
<a href="wss://obscure-waters-98157.herokuapp.com">wss://obscure-waters-98157.herokuapp.com</a> </p>
  <p> What happens if you send a message: ”LOGO”? </p>
  <div class="ui inverted segment">
      Click <a href="Lab3.1.html"> here </a> to go the Web Chat Client.<br>

      When I sent message "LOGO", the message turned into the emoticons which were created from the symbol.

  <strong> <p>2. Local Storage </p></strong>
  <p>Read this article about local storage: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API/Using_the_Web_Storage_API</a> </p>
  <p> Do all examples on the page </p>

      Click <a href="Lab3.2.html">here</a> to go the Local Storage. <br>

  <strong> <p>3. Audio Element </p></strong>
  Read this article: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML5_audio_and_video</a>
  Create a simple web radio (stream) player. Use html5 audio element. Audio player should
  have ”own” play / stop buttons and volume control. Don’t use standard controls in this
  case.
  Use for example this stream: <a href="http://stream.basso.fi:8000/stream">http://stream.basso.fi:8000/stream</a>
  <div class="ui inverted segment">
      Click <a href="audio.html"> here </a> to go to the audio page exercise.
